# Customer-Churn-Predictor
## Overview
 This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn (churn: 1 = will churn, 0 = will stay) using historical telecom customer data. The model aims to help businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and take targeted actions to improve retention.

 We use a Random Forest Classifier, optimized using RandomizedSearchCV, to achieve high predictive performance. The project addresses class imbalance with SMOTE, ensures fairness, supports business-driven decisions, and emphasizes model interpretability.
