# Customer-Churn-Predictor
## Overview
 This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn (churn: 1 = will churn, 0 = will stay) using historical telecom customer data. The model aims to help businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and take targeted actions to improve retention.

 We use a Random Forest Classifier, optimized using RandomizedSearchCV, to achieve high predictive performance. The project addresses class imbalance with SMOTE, ensures fairness, supports business-driven decisions, and emphasizes model interpretability.
   
## Objectives
* Improve Customer Retention Accuracy
Build a robust model to accurately predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service).

* Minimize Revenue Loss
Identify high-risk churn customers early to enable proactive retention strategies and reduce revenue leakage.

* Support Data-Driven Retention Campaigns
Provide actionable insights to guide personalized offers, loyalty programs, and customer engagement efforts.

* Promote Fairness and Inclusivity
Analyze churn risk across demographic groups to detect and mitigate potential biases in predictions.

* Enable Scalable and Automated Decision-Making
Integrate the model into customer relationship management (CRM) systems for real-time churn flagging and automation.

* Ensure Interpretability and Transparency
Use feature importance and visual explanations to help stakeholders understand and trust model outputs.

## Key Features
* Dataset: ~7,040 rows with features such as tenure, MonthlyCharges, Contract, PaymentMethod, InternetService, and Churn.

+ Random Forest Classifier (best_rf) optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.

+ Model saved as random_forest_churn_model.joblib.

* Evaluation Metrics:

+ Accuracy: 0.96

+ Precision: 0.93

+ Recall: 0.84

+ F1 Score: 0.88

+ ROC AUC: 0.943

* Visualizations:

+ Feature Importance Plot – highlights key drivers of churn such as tenure, MonthlyCharges, and Contract.

+ Confusion Matrix – shows classification performance and distribution of false positives/negatives.

+ Precision-Recall Curve – used for optimal threshold tuning.

+ ROC Curve – visualizes trade-off between TPR and FPR.

+ (Optional) SHAP/ELI5 explanations – (insert if added later).

## Key Insights
+ Top predictors: tenure, MonthlyCharges, Contract, InternetService, and PaymentMethod were the most influential in predicting customer churn, with tenure being the strongest.

+ SMOTE significantly improved recall (0.84), enhancing the model’s ability to detect customers likely to churn.

+ Feature Importance Plot highlighted key churn drivers, enabling targeted retention strategies. Incorporating SHAP values is recommended for deeper interpretability and fairness assessment.

+ Confusion Matrix confirmed reliable prediction distribution, supporting automation of churn risk detection.

+ ROC Curve demonstrated strong model performance, with Random Forest achieving an AUC of 0.943, outperforming baseline models like Logistic Regression.

## Conclusion
## Conclusion
###  1.Improved Churn Prediction Accuracy
The optimized Random Forest model effectively captures customer behavior patterns, leveraging features like customer service calls, international plan, and usage metrics for accurate churn prediction.

###  2.Enhanced Churn Risk Detection
Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE significantly improves the model's ability to identify high-risk customers, reducing missed churners and enabling timely retention strategies.

###  3.Customer-Centric Decision-Making
Encoding features such as state, account length, and plan subscriptions allows for deeper segmentation and potential bias analysis. However, further fairness evaluation is essential to ensure equitable treatment of all customer groups.

###  4.Efficient, Scalable Deployment
Model automation using joblib facilitates seamless deployment of the churn model, enhancing operational efficiency and enabling proactive customer engagement at scale.

###  5.Transparent Model Interpretability
Feature importance analysis highlights the most influential churn drivers, improving trust and communication with stakeholders and supporting data-driven decisions.

###  6.Key Predictors & Business Insights

* Customer Service Calls: Strongest indicator of potential churn.

* Usage Metrics (e.g., Day Minutes/Charges): Reflect customer engagement and satisfaction.

* Plan Subscriptions (e.g., International & Voice Mail): Offer insight into service value.

* Account Longevity & Location: Contribute to customer profiling and experience assessment.

###  7.Alignment with Business Goals
The model strengthens churn prediction accuracy, enables targeted retention efforts, supports equity in treatment, and enhances operational efficiency—advancing strategic goals for customer lifecycle management.

###  8.Future Improvements
Ongoing efforts such as performance monitoring, threshold tuning, and applying fairness metrics will further refine model performance while maintaining ethical standards in customer management.

## Recommendations
### 1. Validate Class Imbalance Handling

* Assess the distribution of churn vs. non-churn customers to quantify class imbalance.

* Apply SMOTE or other oversampling methods only to training data for unbiased evaluation.

* Explore alternatives like adjusting class weights or combining oversampling with undersampling for improved balance.

### 2. Enhance Fairness in Retention Strategy

* Analyze model predictions across demographic groups (e.g., state, plan type) to detect potential bias.

* Implement fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity, demographic parity) to ensure equitable customer treatment.

* Promote inclusion by ensuring retention efforts do not disproportionately target or ignore specific customer segments.

### 3. Optimize Decision Threshold

* Adjust the classification threshold to prioritize identifying churners accurately.

* Use precision-recall curves to balance false positives with the need for proactive intervention.

* Minimize false positives to maintain positive customer relationships and avoid unnecessary retention costs.

### 4. Implement Cross-Validation

* Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance across different customer segments.

* Ensure robust generalization to unseen churn patterns.
* Monitor recall and F1 score to confirm model reliability in identifying churn risk.

### 5. Incorporate Telecom Business Standards

* Integrate domain-relevant indicators such as customer service calls, usage patterns, and billing metrics.

* Apply such metrics as feature engineering inputs or threshold adjustment levers.

* Align model outputs with business KPIs to increase trust and operational value.

### 6. Deploy and Monitor Model Performance

* Deploy the churn model for real-time prediction of at-risk customers.

* Establish continuous performance monitoring to adapt to evolving customer behaviors.

* Retrain the model periodically using updated data to maintain predictive accuracy.

### 7. Enhance Stakeholder Transparency

* Provide clear, interpretable explanations for churn risk scores, especially for high-risk customers.

* Leverage feature importance insights to communicate drivers of churn.

* Foster trust among marketing, support, and executive teams through transparent model outputs.

### 8. Streamline Operational Integration

* Integrate the saved model seamlessly into customer relationship management (CRM) or retention platforms.

* Automate flagging and outreach workflows to reduce manual churn analysis and save resources.

* Ensure the solution is scalable to handle large customer bases and support rapid growth.
